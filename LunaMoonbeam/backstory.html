    <h1 class="text-center">Background Story</h1>
    <p>Luna Moonbeam was born beneath a full winter moon, her first howl echoing through the walls of her family’s hidden home. Long before her birth, her father had been wounded by a werewolf during a scouting mission outside the city. The curse settled deep into his blood, and before the priests could purge it, Luna’s mother discovered she was pregnant. Their child would inherit more than a name. She would be born with the ancient hunger of the moon in her bones. Her parents tried to give her a normal life, and as a small child Luna even attempted to hide her wolf ears and bushy tail beneath scarves and oversized clothes. But the city’s laws were sharp as steel against her kind, and the people’s eyes sharper still. The disguise never lasted long: a twitch of her ears when startled, her tail slipping free when she laughed or yawned. Whispers followed her everywhere. Instead of risking a mob or execution, her parents made a desperate choice. They brought her to the one group they believed would protect her without question: The Zhentarim. Among those whispered halls, bargains were a language and survival a craft. A woman known only as Blackfeather agreed to take Luna in, on the condition that one day the child would repay what she was given. Luna grew up in back rooms and alley shadows, never fully indoors, never fully outside. She learned to move quiet as snowfall, to vanish when guards approached, and to listen for the rhythm of footsteps the way others listened to drums. By the time she was ten, she knew how to lift a purse, slip through a window, barter food, and outrun almost any grown thief. The Zhentarim gave guidance, but never without cost. When they called for errands, Luna ran them. When they demanded secrets, she found them. Their lessons sharpened her instincts faster than childhood ever could. Still, even with their help, she belonged nowhere. People avoided her in the streets. They noticed the odd bulge beneath her hood, the way her clothing never quite hid who she was, the faint swish of a tail she tried so hard to pin down. Unlike other lycanthropes, Luna couldn’t disguise her nature completely, no matter how tightly she wrapped herself up. Eventually, the strain of hiding became another weight she carried. Everything changed the day she met the hounds. A pack of stray dogs roamed the city’s forgotten edges, just as unwanted as she was. Luna shared scraps and warmth with them until they accepted her scent among their own. The first time they pressed against her without hesitation, she let her hood fall. She let her tail move freely. And the world didn’t end. They became her constant companions, her watchful guards, and her truest family. With them, she no longer tried to fold herself into a shape that fit the city’s fears. She embraced the wolf inside her, not as a curse but as her heartbeat. She didn’t fear transformation. She felt right when the moonlight kissed her fur. The Zhentarim still offered help when needed, but help always came with a mission: messages to deliver, doors to unlock, items to “recover.” Luna never questioned it. Every task she completed taught her more about life, survival, and the shadowed roads between power and hunger. Now twelve years old, Luna walks the boundary between girl and wolf, between obedience and independence. She no longer hides what she is — not from herself, not from her pack, not from the moon. The world may not accept her, but she refuses to tuck her tail beneath her coat ever again. She has a pack. She has teeth. And she will carve out her own place in a world that tried to bury her before she could speak.</p>
